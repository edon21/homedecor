                <p>
                    We do not accept returns for our products.
                    This is because the products are delicate and need extra packaging to make sure that it isn’t
                    damaged in transit.
                    Since it might not be possible for the customers to repack it in its original condition,
                    returning the product and getting a refund would not be feasible.
                </p>
